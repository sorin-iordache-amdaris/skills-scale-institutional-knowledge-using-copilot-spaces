This README serves as the central entry point for all OctoAcme project management processes and resources, providing quick access and context for all contributors and stakeholders.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme employs a structured, iterative project management lifecycle designed to deliver customer value efficiently while maintaining high quality. The process begins with a formal **Initiation** phase where initiatives are validated through a "Project One-pager" and stakeholder alignment before moving to **Planning**. In the planning stage, work is broken down into prioritized backlogs with clear acceptance criteria and estimations, ensuring that dependencies and risks are identified early. This foundation sets the stage for the **Execution** phase, where teams work in sprints or iterations, utilizing daily standups and weekly syncs to track progress and unblock issues promptly.

Key **personas** driving these projects include the Product Manager (PdM), who defines the "what" and "why" by owning the product vision and backlog; the Project Manager (PM), who coordinates the "how" and "when" by managing schedules, risks, and communications; and the Delivery Team (Developers and QA), responsible for implementing features and ensuring technical excellence. **Communication strategies** are vital to this ecosystem, featuring a regular rhythm of updates: daily standups for the core team, weekly syncs between PM and PdM, and monthly stakeholder updates. Risks are actively managed through a Risk Register and clear escalation paths to ensuring transparency.

**Quality assurance** and **workflows** are deeply integrated into the development process. The engineering workflow emphasizes small, manageable Pull Requests (under 400 lines) that must pass automated CI checks—including linting and security scanning—before peer review. Testing strategies encompass unit tests for new logic, integration tests, and mandatory end-to-end smoke tests prior to release. Deployment follows a rigorous checklist approach with defined rollback plans, ensuring stability. Finally, a culture of continuous improvement is fostered through regular retrospectives that generate actionable items to refine processes after each milestone or incident.
