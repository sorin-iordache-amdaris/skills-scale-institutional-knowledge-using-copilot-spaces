# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (facilitated by PM or Scrum Master)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (led by PdM, with support from Business Analyst)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points, with Technical Lead and developers)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) with team consensus
5. Identify dependencies and integration points (with Technical Lead input)
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. Conduct user research or design sprints (with UX Designer) if needed
8. Define technical approach and architecture (with Technical Lead)
