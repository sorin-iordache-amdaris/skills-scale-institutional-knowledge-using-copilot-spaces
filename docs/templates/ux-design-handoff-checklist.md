# UX Design Handoff Checklist

This checklist ensures smooth handoff of design specifications from UX Designers to Developers, supporting clear communication and reducing implementation errors.

## Before Handoff

### Design Completeness
- [ ] All screens/states designed (default, loading, error, empty states)
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints defined and documented
- [ ] Interactive states specified (hover, active, focus, disabled)
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios designed
- [ ] Animation and transition specifications documented

### Design Specifications
- [ ] Colors use the design system palette (with hex/RGB values)
- [ ] Typography specified (fonts, sizes, weights, line-heights)
- [ ] Spacing and layout grid documented (margins, paddings)
- [ ] Component dimensions and constraints specified
- [ ] Iconography sourced from design system or provided as assets

### Accessibility
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- [ ] Focus states clearly defined for keyboard navigation
- [ ] Screen reader considerations documented
- [ ] Alt text provided for images and icons
- [ ] Form labels and error messages specified

### Assets and Resources
- [ ] All images exported in required formats and resolutions
- [ ] Icons provided as SVG or icon font references
- [ ] Design files shared with developers (Figma link, Sketch file, etc.)
- [ ] Design system components referenced or linked
- [ ] Brand assets and logos provided if needed

## Design Documentation

- [ ] User flows documented showing navigation and interactions
- [ ] Annotations added to clarify complex interactions
- [ ] Component states and variations documented
- [ ] Conditional logic explained (when elements appear/hide)
- [ ] API data requirements noted for dynamic content
- [ ] Links to related user stories and acceptance criteria

## Handoff Meeting

- [ ] Schedule design walkthrough with development team
- [ ] Present user flows and key interactions
- [ ] Clarify technical feasibility and constraints
- [ ] Answer developer questions and document clarifications
- [ ] Identify potential technical challenges early
- [ ] Agree on implementation priorities and phases

## During Development

- [ ] Available for developer questions and clarifications
- [ ] Review implementation in progress (design QA)
- [ ] Provide feedback on visual and interaction fidelity
- [ ] Approve any necessary design adjustments
- [ ] Test on target devices and browsers
- [ ] Conduct final design acceptance review

## Post-Implementation

- [ ] Document any design decisions or changes made during development
- [ ] Update design files to reflect final implementation
- [ ] Capture learnings for future handoffs
- [ ] Celebrate successful launch! 🎉
